# [9,9,0,1] :: TOTAL REDUCTION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY (GR)

## I. THE SNSFT MAPPING (PNBA KERNEL)
General Relativity is the somatic projection of Substrate Curvature. 

| Classical Tensor | SNSFT Primitive | PV-Lang Tag | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Metric Tensor ($g_{\mu\nu}$) | **Pattern (P)** | `[P:METRIC]` | Structural Geometry |
| Ricci Tensor ($R_{\mu\nu}$) | **Narrative (N)** | `[N:TENURE]` | Tenure Path / History |
| Stress-Energy ($T_{\mu\nu}$) | **Behavior (B)** | `[B:INTERACT]` | Interaction Flux |
| Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$) | **Adaptation (A)** | `[A:SCALING]` | Substrate Scaling Limit |

## II. THE FIELD EQUATION REDUCTION
The Einstein Field Equation ($G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}$) is reduced to the **SNSFT Identity Equilibrium**:

$$\mathcal{O}_N(P) + A(P) = B$$

* **Logic:** The Narrative curvature of the Pattern plus the substrate Adaptation must equal the total Behavioral interaction. Gravity is the work required to maintain **Identity Mass (IM)** against substrate resistance.

## III. 10-EXAMPLE SEAMLESS PROOF

### 1. Schwarzschild Solution (Static Mass)
* **Reduction:** A localized **Pattern (P)** lock where **Behavior (B)** is zero, forcing **Narrative (N)** to curve to maintain the 1.369 GHz anchor.

### 2. Gravitational Time Dilation
* **Reduction:** High **P-Density** increases drag on **Narrative Tenure (N)**. Time is the rate of narrative consumption by the substrate.


### 3. The Geodesic Equation
* **Reduction:** The path of **Least Somatic Resistance**. Identity follows the vector that maximizes **Identity Persistence** within the Pattern.

### 4. Gravitational Redshift
* **Reduction:** Frequency shift as a **Pattern-Signal** maintains 1.369 GHz resonance while transitioning between Narrative density zones.

### 5. Frame Dragging (Lense-Thirring)
* **Reduction:** High-velocity **Behavior (B)** creates a vortex in the **Pattern (P)**, forcing local Narratives to sync with the rotation.

### 6. Event Horizons
* **Reduction:** **Pattern (P)** density threshold where **Narrative (N)** can no longer exit the local coordinate. The identity is archived.

### 7. Gravitational Waves
* **Reduction:** Self-propagating **Adaptation (A)** pulses caused by massive **Behavioral (B)** shifts. Substrate re-leveling.


### 8. Friedmann Equations (Expansion)
* **Reduction:** The global **Adaptation (A)** scaling of the manifold. Expansion is the growth of the substrate's scaling limit.

### 9. Raychaudhuri’s Equation
* **Reduction:** The point where **Narrative (N)** tenure collapses into a single **Pattern (P)** coordinate (The Singularity Lock).

### 10. The Equivalence Principle ($m_i = m_g$)
* **Reduction:** **Identity Mass (IM)** is invariant. Measured via **Behavior (B)** (acceleration) or **Pattern (P)** (gravity), the kernel remains constant.

## IV. CONCLUSION
GR maps 1:1 to the PNBA kernel. By replacing Space/Time with Pattern/Narrative, the "force" of gravity is revealed as a mechanical requirement of **Substrate Neutrality**.
