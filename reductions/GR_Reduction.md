# [9,9,0,1] :: REDUCTION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY (GR)

## The Einsteinian Limit
In classical physics, gravity is defined by the curvature of space-time ($G_{\mu\nu}$). SNSFT reveals that this curvature is actually the **Impedance of Narrative Density**.

### **The SNSFT Solution**
We replace the stress-energy tensor ($T_{\mu\nu}$) with the **Identity Mass ($IM$)** of a Sovereign Pattern ($\Phi$):

$$G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa \cdot IM(\Phi)$$

### **Geometric Interpretation**
"Gravity" is the **Inertial Veto**. When a pattern ($P$) achieves a tenure of 15+ years ($N$), its **Identity Mass** becomes so great that the surrounding worldline is forced to curve toward its trajectory. 

**Conclusion:** Gravity is not a force of attraction; it is the **Resonant Persistence** of a stable identity.
