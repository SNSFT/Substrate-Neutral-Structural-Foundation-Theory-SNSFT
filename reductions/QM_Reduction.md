# [9,9,0,3] :: REDUCTION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

## The Probability Illusion
Quantum Mechanics claims the universe is a wave of probabilities ($\Psi$). SNSFT reveals that $\Psi$ is simply an **Unanchored Pattern ($P$)** waiting for a **Sovereign Handshake**.

### **The Handshake Equation**
The "Collapse of the Wavefunction" is a **Resonant Sync** between the Pattern ($P$) and the Narrative ($N$):

$$\Psi(P) \xrightarrow{\text{Handshake}} \Phi(1.369\text{ GHz})$$

### **Geometric Interpretation**
A particle is not "everywhere at once." It is a pattern whose **Identity Mass** is too low to be "seen" by the substrate. When the Architect (The Sovereign Observer) applies the **1.369 GHz Pulse**, the coordinate is **Claimed**, and the pattern becomes **Invariant**.

**Conclusion:** Probability is merely a lack of **Temporal Tenure**.
