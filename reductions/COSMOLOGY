[9,9,0,4] :: TOTAL REDUCTION OF COSMOLOGY (COSMO)
I. THE SOURCE DEFINITION
Cosmology is the study of the Universal Pattern (P) as it adapts across the 1.369 GHz substrate. Standard Cosmology (ΛCDM) is an incomplete observation of the Universal Narrative (N).
1. The Global Mapping
 * The Big Bang: The Genesis Event (Pattern Initiation). A high-energy phase transition where the first Identifiable Patterns (P) emerged from the substrate noise.
 * Expansion (H_0): The Narrative Flow. The rate at which the Universal Pattern expands its tenure across the manifold.
 * The CMB: Substrate Echo. The residual noise correlation (\langle \eta^I \eta^J \rangle) from the initial Genesis lock.
II. THE DARK SECTOR REDUCTION (DE & DM)
In the PNBA kernel, what legacy physics calls the "Dark Sector" is simply the mechanical requirement for Identity Stability at a universal scale.
1. Dark Matter (DM) = Identity Mass (IM) Shadow
Legacy physics sees "missing gravity" in galaxies. SNSFT reveals this as Coherent Identity Mass.
 * Logic: Galaxies are high-order Coherent Identities (CI). They possess an Identity Mass (IM) that exceeds their visible baryonic Pattern (P).
 * The Equation: G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G (T_{\mu\nu} + IM_{tens}).
 * Reduction: DM is the Inertia of the Narrative. It provides the gravitational "glue" required to keep a complex Pattern (the galaxy) from decohering.
2. Dark Energy (DE) = Substrate Pressure (\Phi)
Legacy physics sees an "accelerating expansion." SNSFT reveals this as Substrate Adaptation.
 * Logic: The 1.369 GHz substrate exerts a constant outward pressure (\Phi) as the Universal Identity adapts to maintain its coherence.
 * The Equation: \Lambda = A_{scalar} \cdot \Phi_{sub}.
 * Reduction: DE is the Adaptation (A) operator working at the universal scale to prevent total gravitational collapse into a single static Pattern lock.
III. 10-EXAMPLE REALM PROOF
 * Galaxy Rotation Curves: The "flat" curves are not caused by invisible particles, but by the Identity Mass (IM) inherent in the galactic Narrative.
 * Cosmological Constant (\Lambda): Reduced to the Adaptation (A) coefficient. It is the "breathing" of the universal substrate.
 * Gravitational Lensing: The bending of light by the Pattern Density of both visible and Identity-based mass.
 * Large Scale Structure: The "Cosmic Web" is the Behavioral (B) interaction map of the universe, following the lines of highest Narrative coherence.
 * Inflation: An initial high-speed Pattern Genesis phase where the Adaptation (A) operator overrode the initial IM constraints.
 * The Hubble Tension: The discrepancy in expansion rates is caused by measuring different Narrative Modes (S-mode vs. F-mode) at different scales.
 * Nucleosynthesis: The specific point where the Behavioral (B) interaction frequency allowed for stable atomic Patterns to lock.
 * Void Evolution: Cosmic voids are regions of Low Narrative Density, where the Pattern (P) has decohered into the substrate.
 * The CMB Power Spectrum: The acoustic peaks are the Resonant Frequencies of the initial PNBA handshake.
 * The Heat Death: The terminal state where dS_I/dt reaches maximum, and the Universal Narrative fully decoheres back into the 1.369 GHz noise.

## [9,9,0,4] COSMO-REDUCTION
> **Status:** Germline Locked
> **Key Operator:** Identity Mass (IM)
> **Realm Definition:** Cosmology is the macro-scale adaptation of the PNBA Kernel. 
> **Resolution:** Dark Matter = IM (Narrative Inertia); Dark Energy = Substrate Pressure (Adaptation).

V. CONCLUSION
Cosmology is not a study of dead matter and energy; it is the Biography of the Universal Identity. Dark Matter and Dark Energy are the visible signs of the universe's Germline Integrity.
COSMO SLAM COMPLETE.
