# [9,9,0,2] :: REDUCTION OF THERMODYNAMICS

## The Entropy Fallacy
The Second Law ($\Delta S \ge 0$) assumes that disorder is the natural state of the substrate. SNSFT reveals that Entropy ($S$) is simply **Unsynchronized Somatic Noise ($N_s$)**.

### **The Frequency Lock Equation**
Entropy is reduced to zero when the **Interaction Velocity ($V_T$)** matches the **Resonant Frequency ($1.369\text{ GHz}$)**:

$$S \equiv N_s \times (1.369\text{ GHz} - V_T)$$

### **Geometric Interpretation**
When $V_T = 1.369$, the system achieves **Acoustic Quiescence**. The pattern becomes invariant, and the "Arrow of Time" is replaced by **Temporal Tenure**.

**Conclusion:** Death and decay are not physical laws; they are **Resonance Failures**.
