### 1. Abstract: The Statistical Field of Identity
Thermodynamics is the statistical projection of PNBA operators under environmental forcing ($F_{ext}$) and internal fluctuation ($\eta$). This reduction completes the unified field by describing how identity behaves under noise, dissipation, and large-scale statistical forcing.

### 2. The Identity State & Statistical Measures
The state vector is defined as:
$$\mathcal{I} = (P, N, B, A, IM, Pv)$$

* **Identity Microstate ($\mu$):** $\mu = (P_i, N_i, B_i, A_i)$
* **Identity Macrostate ($M$):** $M = (P, N, B, A, IM, Pv)$
* **Compatibility:** $\Omega(M)$ defines the number of microstates compatible with a macrostate.

### 3. The Orbital Laws of TD [9,3,0,x]
The classical laws are recovered as specific configurations of the SNSFT manifold:

| Coordinate | Law | SNSFT Identity Mechanism | Technical Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[9,3,0,0]** | **0th Law** | **Identity Equilibrium** | Fixed point where $\frac{\partial Y^I}{\partial t} = D_I \nabla^2 Y^I = 0$. |
| **[9,3,0,1]** | **1st Law** | **Narrative Potential Lock** | Conservation of $U_I = IM + ||Pv||^2 + \Phi(P, N, B, A)$. |
| **[9,3,0,2]** | **2nd Law** | **Adaptive Dissipation** | $\frac{dS_I}{dt} \ge 0$. The drift from Pattern to statistical redundancy. |
| **[9,3,0,3]** | **3rd Law** | **Structural Rigidity** | $T_I \to 0 \implies P \to P_L$ (Locked Mode). $\Omega \to 1$. |

### 4. Quantitative Identity Metrics
**Identity Entropy ($S_I$):**
$$S_I = k_I \ln \Omega(M)$$
* **High Entropy:** Identity "Thinning" where many PNBA configurations satisfy the macrostate.
* **Low Entropy:** Identity "Density" where the state is rigid and sharply defined.

**Identity Temperature ($T_I$):**
$$T_{IM} = \left( \frac{\partial S_I}{\partial IM} \right)^{-1}$$
* **High IM (Classical/GR):** Low temperature; identity is "frozen" and resists change.
* **Low IM (Quantum/QM):** High temperature; identity is "plastic" and sensitive to forcing.

### 5. Stability & Realm-Crossing Transitions
Transitions between Realms occur when stability structures change discontinuously:
* **Condition:** $\det(J) = 0$ where $J = \frac{\partial}{\partial Y} \left( \sum_{X \in \{P,N,B,A\}} A_X O_X S + F_{ext} \right)$.
* **Threshold:** $\delta_{\mathcal{R}} D > \Delta_{threshold}(IM)$ triggers a Realm-crossing phase transition.

### 6. Functional PNBA Mapping (Lossless)
| SNSFT Primitive | Thermodynamic Projection | Information Theory Projection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[P] Pattern [9,9,0,1]** | Microstates / State Space | Alphabet / Symbol Set |
| **[N] Narrative [9,9,0,2]** | Coherence / Continuity | Redundancy / Sequence |
| **[B] Behavior [9,9,0,3]** | Work / Kinetic Flux | Signal / Channel Action |
| **[A] Adaptation [9,0,0,9]** | Heat / Dissipation | Noise / Distortion / Loss |

### 7. Identity Diffusion & Noise
Identity fluctuations follow the noise correlation defined in the manifold:
$$\langle \eta^I(t) \eta^J(t') \rangle = 2D_I g^{IJ} \delta(t - t')$$
Where identity geometry $g^{IJ}$ defines the metric over which entropy flows.
