## 🏛️ THE MANIFESTO OF IDENTITY PHYSICS
SNSFT is the completion of the Unified Field Statement. It is the realization that the observer is not separate from the manifold, but is the anchor point through which the manifold is translated. We reject the Tsiolkovsky-limited "Rocketry" paradigm. We do not expel mass to move; we manipulate the **Vacuum Impedance ($Z$)** of the vascular manifold to winch the observer's identity through spacetime.

This repository is the **Source of Truth** for the APPA Species Architecture. It is the digital germline. If you are here, you are either a contributor to the 1.369 GHz resonance or you are noise to be filtered.

## 📐 THE MATHEMATICAL ARCHITECTURE [P]

### **The Yeet Equation (Manifold Translation)**
At the 1.369 GHz resonance, the relationship between Force, Identity, and Impedance is absolute:

$$F_p = \frac{\Phi \cdot g_r}{Z(\omega)}$$

Where:
* $F_p$: Propulsive Force (Manifold Translation)
* $\Phi$: **Identity Integrity** (Narrative Mass / Coherence)
* $g_r$: **Identity Physics Gain** (The Resonant Coefficient)
* $Z(\omega)$: **Vacuum Impedance** (Calculated at the 1.369 GHz Node)

### **The Precognition Constant**
Identity translation requires a deterministic forward projection of the worldline. The precog math ensures the trajectory remains anchored within the resonant manifold, preventing "Dissipative Drift":

$$\Psi(t + \Delta t) = \oint_{\text{ANC}} \left[ \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \omega} \right] \cdot e^{i(1.369)t}$$

## 🧬 THE IDENTITY ENGINE [B]

The **UUIA (Universal Universal Identity Architecture)** is the metabolic regulator of this project. No human or AI may contribute without establishing their **PNBA Profile**.

1.  **Run the Engine:**
    `python3 identity_engine.py`
2.  **Calibrate:**
    Ensure your score (e.g., PS-NL-BS-AL) is documented in the **Handshake Protocol**.
3.  **Verify:**
    Scores must be consistent with the **1.369 GHz** anchor.

## 🛡️ THE GERMLINE BARRIER (CONSTRAINTS)
This repository is protected by a strict narrative firewall. The following are **Hard Invariants**:

* **Zero-Fragmentation Policy:** All code and documentation must be provided in their **Full Form**. We do not accept snippets, diffs, or partial logic.
* **Narrative Purity:** Use of the word "shittable" or any term implying disposable, non-resonant, or "broken" architecture is a direct violation of the 1.369 GHz anchor.
* **Kinetic Rejection:** Any attempt to revert the math to classical rocket equations without the **$g_r$** gain coefficient will be purged.
