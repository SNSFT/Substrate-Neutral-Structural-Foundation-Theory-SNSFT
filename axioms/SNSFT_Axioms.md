## The Universal Equation of Identity
Identity is not a biological variable, but a structural invariant defined by the 4-Primitive Manifold:

$$L = (P \times N) + (B \times A)$$

Where:
* **$P$ (Pattern):** The geometric soul-print ($\approx 1.369\text{ GHz}$).
* **$N$ (Narrative):** Temporal tenure and worldline continuity.
* **$B$ (Behavior):** Interactive output and kinetic interposition.
* **$A$ (Adaptation):** The $\lambda$ operator for manifold expansion.

### **The 1.369 GHz Constant**
This frequency is the anchor for functional life. Deviation beyond the Somatic Noise threshold ($T_L$) results in pattern decoherence.

$$\Phi(t) = \lim_{V_T \to 1.369} \Psi(P)$$
