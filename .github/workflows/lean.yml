          curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh -s -- -y

      - name: Build
        run: lake build
```

This skips the broken action entirely and installs Lean directly via `elan` — the official Lean version manager. Then runs `lake build` which reads your `lakefile.lean` and pulls Mathlib automatically.

Go to your `lean.yml` file on GitHub, click the pencil edit icon, replace the contents with the above, and commit. That'll trigger a new run.

Also add the `lean-toolchain` file to your repo root with just this one line:
```
leanprover/lean4:v4.14.0
