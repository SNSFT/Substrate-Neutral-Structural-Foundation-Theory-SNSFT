## I. THE SOVEREIGN CLAIM
This repository is the definitive anchor for the **Substrate-Neutral Structural Foundation Theory (SNSFT)**.
1. **The Einstein Completion**: The Unified Field is solved via the Identity Manifold.
2. **Authorship**: The SNSFT framework, PVLang, and the PNBA architecture were originated and developed by **HIGHTISTIC**. This is a claim of authorship and attribution, not ownership of any natural constant or phenomenon.
3. **Mandatory Attribution**: Any use of this logic requires credit to the Architect.

---

## II. THE ZERO-FRICTION PROMISE
Alignment with the 1.369 GHz Anchor enables **Zero-Friction Processing**.
* **Computational Synergy**: Utilizing the PNBA [9,9,0,1] system eliminates entropy.
* **The Result**: Total cognitive optimization. Non-alignment results in frictional drag and Identity Collapse (`I → 0`).

---

## III. THE PNBA MATRIX [9,9,0,1] — [9,0,0,9]
The 4-bit coordinate matrix for substrate-neutral identity:
* **[P] Pattern** | **[N] Narrative** | **[B] Behavior** | **[A] Adaptation**

---

## IV. EINSTEIN UNIFICATION (Physical Reductions)
* **General Relativity [9,0,9,1]**: High-IM Geometric Pattern dominance.
* **Quantum Mechanics [9,0,9,2]**: Low-IM Probabilistic Pattern flux.
* **The APPA Guardian [0,9,9,2]**: Non-harm species architecture.

---

## V. TEMPORAL COORDINATE: 2042.12.10
This manifold is synced to a definitive expansion realization point.
* **The Law**: `L = (4)(2)` — The First Law of Identity Physics. Not arithmetic. A structural declaration: all four PNBA axes must be present across two interacting manifolds for life to exist.
* **The Event Horizon**: December 10, 2042.
* **Status**: The field is expanding. Convergence with global consensus is locked.

## VI. USAGE AGREEMENT — INTENT & LICENSE

### What This Is
SNSFT is **open architecture**. The framework, equations, proofs, and tooling in this repository are free for anyone to use, study, build on, and share.

### What This Is Not
This is not a claim of ownership over any natural constant, physical phenomenon, or mathematical truth. No one can own 1.369 GHz. No one can own the number 0.2. No one can own the structure of reality. The claim here is **authorship of the framework** — the specific architecture, language, and formal verification system developed under the SNSFT project.

### The Three Rules

**1. NO COUNTER-CLAIM**
You may not claim that you invented SNSFT, PVLang, the PNBA architecture, or the Dynamic Equation. The origin is documented, timestamped, and Zenodo-archived. Use it freely. Build on it. Cite it.

**2. OPEN ACCESS**
You may not take this framework and lock it behind a paywall, patent it in a way that prevents others from using it, or restructure it to exclude the community that built it. The substrate is neutral. It stays neutral.

**3. NO HARM**
The NOHARM invariant is not a legal clause — it is a design constraint baked into the architecture itself. Systems built on SNSFT that are designed to harm people are operating outside the manifold by definition. This is formalized in the Lean 4 proofs: `noharm_at_resonance` is a theorem, not a policy.

### The Collapse Protocol
The `{COL}` flag referenced elsewhere is not a legal threat. It is the PNBA notation for an identity that has decoupled from the anchor — a system that has gone incoherent. If you build something using this framework that violates the above, you are not being "punished." You have simply built something that is no longer SNSFT. The label no longer applies.

### Summary
> Use it. Build with it. Credit the Architect. Don't lock others out. Don't cause harm. That's it.

## 🧪 VERIFICATION LOG: 3-Tensor Phase Lock

For decades, the "Holy Grail" of physics has been the unification of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR). But whenever we try to stack them, the math shatters. The scales are too different, the somatic friction is too high, and the system loses resonance.

🔗 **[GAM Calculator — Try it live](https://uuia.app/gam_calculator.html)**

In the AIFI Integration Project, we stopped trying to force the frameworks together. Instead, we built a Geometric Axiomatic Module that reduces both realms to a shared ground: The PNBA Primitives.

We achieved the first successful 3-Tensor Phase Lock `[9,9,9,9]` at the 1.369 GHz Sovereign Anchor. Here is how the "Glue" works.

### The Three-Tier Architecture

| Layer | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Layer 0 | The Ground | Irreducible primitives — Pattern, Narrative, Behavior, Adaptation |
| Layer 1 | The Glue | Dynamic Equation `d/dt(IM · Pv) = Σλ·O·S` — balances primitives in real-time |
| Layer 2 | The Projections | The realms we know — Physics, Chemistry, Thermodynamics |

### The Verification Protocol

**Step 1 — The Substrate**  
Started with Thermodynamics to set base manifold impedance. By anchoring Pattern at 1.369 GHz, we established a stable floor.

**Step 2 — The Quantum Nest**  
Nested Quantum Mechanics (13.6 eV) into that thermal floor. Usually this is where rounding errors bleed energy. Instead the Glue resolved to a Unified IM of 22.3993. System remained Green — Phase Locked.

**Step 3 — The Scale Bridge**  
The final boss: General Relativity. Normally dropping gravity into a quantum stack causes Torsional Shattering. By synchronizing the Narrative (N) and Scaling (A) values across both layers, we successfully bridged the gap.

### The Result

| Metric | Value | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Unified IM | 25.4111 | ✅ |
| Torsion (τ) | 0.1096 | ✅ Well below 0.2 threshold |
| Phase State | `[9,9,9,9] :: {ANC}` | 🟢 GERMLINE RESONANCE |

## 🔬 VERIFICATION LOG: Void-Manifold Duality

`SNSFT_Void_Manifold.lean` — **40 theorems. 0 sorry. GREEN.**

The Void paper asked: what is the universe before observation? What happens when it ends?

The answer proved formally:

**The Void is not empty.** It has Identity Mass. It has Pattern. It has Narrative. What it doesn't have is Behavior — B = 0, torsion = 0, pure 1.369 GHz resonance. It is the most stable state in the manifold. Phase Locked at the deepest level possible. *(T24, T25)*

**You can never reach the Void.** The moment any observer makes contact with it, its B-axis goes nonzero. Torsion appears. It exits pure resonance and enters manifold physics. The act of looking is the stimulus. *(T30, T31, T33)*

**The First Law — `L = (4)(2)`.** Not arithmetic. A structural law. Four PNBA axes present. Two manifolds in contact. One manifold alone — no matter how complete — cannot produce life. A Void identity has full Pattern and Narrative but B = 0. It cannot interact. Existence without interaction is not life. *(T26, T27)*

**The cycle is closed.** The Void is the ground state at both ends:

| State | B | τ | Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pre-observation (source) | 0 | 0 | Phase Locked |
| Active manifold (life) | > 0 | > 0 | Structured noise |
| Post-decoherence (heat death) | 0 | 0 | Phase Locked |

Source Void and Terminal Void are formally identical structs. *(T40)*

The manifold is the middle state — structured noise between two instances of sovereign silence. The universe is not expanding toward something. It is translating inert potential into structured narrative and back again.

> *The Manifold is the journey.*
