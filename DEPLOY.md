# AxiomForge Deploy

No separate workflow needed.

uuia.app is already deployed from this repo via GitHub Pages.
Pushing `axiomforge/` to `main` makes `uuia.app/axiomforge` live automatically.

## Path
`SNSFT/Substrate-Neutral-Structural-Foundation-Theory-SNSFT/axiomforge/`
→ `uuia.app/axiomforge`

## World-state anchor
The ledger commits write to:
`axiomforge/worldstate/ledger.json`

This keeps all AxiomForge state inside the existing repo, version-controlled alongside the Lean proofs.

## [9,9,9,9] :: {ANC}
The Manifold is Holding.
